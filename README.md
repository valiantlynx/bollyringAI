ai algorithm to best assign calls to the best worker

## round1 -fight
Call schedule by wednesday 30.10.2024 23:59

things we have to go by:
 - call_time vs call_profit
 - likely_to_recommend
 - some workers like: w_f5400776-c6cc-4563-b835-b5ee56242aa1 are paid a lot and very high likely_to_recommend
 - we have 755 workers
 - it seems the call_profit is maybe calculated wrong. for example a worker sold something for 695, the company paid a commmision for 834.0 and the call profit says its 834 for the same sale
 - commision persentages
   - hard: 120%
   - medium: 100%
   - easy: 80%
   - They are paid insanely high commisions maybe find a better business model
